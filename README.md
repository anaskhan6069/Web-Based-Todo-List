🎉I've created a web-based to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's been a fantastic journey, and I'm eager to showcase what I've built!
💡My to-do list application is designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. You can add new tasks, mark them as completed by clicking on them, and delete tasks as needed. This responsive to-do list works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

⭐ One of the key features is that your added tasks remain saved on the page even after reloading it, ensuring that you don't lose your progress.
